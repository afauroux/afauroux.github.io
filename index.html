    <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage ü§µ</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="mailto:antoine dot fauroux at gmail dot com">Antoine Fauroux</a> and I'm a doctor in
        physics interested in many things including computer science and programming in general.</p>

    <p>My main programming language is <code>python</code> <em>(pandas, numpy, jupyter, matplotlib)</em>, as I wrote many scripts for physics simulations, data management, and data analysis during my internships and  PhD. I would not release those script because they were only useful for my work but you can consult my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=fr&user=Bwj03iIAAAAJ">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I accumulated many small other projects over the years on my github page and this page is an attempt at advertising my
        programing skills by making those projects easily accessible for whomever might be interested.</p>

        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/BeautifulSnake/"><b>Snake</b></a>: This is the result of
            tests I did with html5 canvas: A simple webpage that allows play snake made with material design
            styling
        <li> <a href="https://catpaint-89d4e.firebaseapp.com/"><b>Cat Paint</b></a>: Another test of html5 canvas and

            run.
        <li> <a href="solitary.html"><b>Solitary</b></a>: A game I played as a kid, that I recreated in html/js to have

    <h2>Other projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/ur/larn/logiciels/nascam">Nascam</a></b>: A modular
            graphical user interface that I wrote in Java over the course of several months, for a kinetic-Monte-Carlo simulation software developed at
            the university of Namur. I also coordinated the work of several other developers and help release this software to the scientific community,
            and I am still as of today involved in improving the software and coordinating developpment.
        <li><b><a href="https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/user.php?id=1040">LowRes NX</b></a>: is a retro-game virtual
            console. I developed several mini-games for this platform with a friend of mine to understand better
            retro-consoles and to have fun. I was also involved in the porting of this console to the <em>RetroArch
                platform</em> so games could be played on any consoles.
        <li><b><a href="https://afauroux.github.io/MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan/">MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan</a></b>: A static
