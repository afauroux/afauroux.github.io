    <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage ü§µ</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="mailto:antoine dot fauroux at gmail dot com">Antoine Fauroux</a> and I'm a doctor in
        physics interested in many things including computer science and programming in general.</p>

    <p>I accumulated many small projects over the years on my github page and this is an attempt at advertising my
        programing skills by making those projects easily accessible for whomever might be interested.</p>
