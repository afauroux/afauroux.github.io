    <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage üëã</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="mailto:antoine dot fauroux at gmail dot com">Antoine Fauroux</a> and I'm a doctor in
        plasma physics interested in many things including computer science and programming in general.</p>

    <p>My main programming language is <code>Python</code> <em>(Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib)</em>, as I
        wrote
        many scripts, notebooks, and modules for physics simulations, data management, and data analysis during my
        studies, research internships, and my PhD. I would
        not release those scripts because they were only useful for my work but you can consult my publications <a
            href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=fr&user=Bwj03iIAAAAJ">here</a>.</p>

    <p>While learning JS/HTML/CSS, I wrote several fun little webpages and small projects on my GitHub and this page is
        showcasing and making those projects easily accessible for whomever might be interested.
        Here is a list of the ones that are more or less finished and accessible online: </p>

    <h2>Small <code>html/css/js</code> projects</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/chess/"><b>Chess RTC</b></a>: quick and easy chess game, made out of
            javascript/html/css using the lib <code>chess.js</code> from <code>@jhlywa</code>, and allowing connection
            between two players in p2p via
            webRTC
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/BeautifulSnake/"><b>Snake</b></a>: This is the result of
            tests I did with HTML5 canvas: A simple webpage that allows playing snake made with material design
            styling
        <li> <a href="https://catpaint-89d4e.firebaseapp.com/"><b>Cat Paint</b></a>: Another test of HTML5 canvas and
            hosted on Firebase, that I did in collaboration with my sister, where you can paint with cat emojis üêà
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/conway-game-of-life/"><b>Conway's game of life</b></a>: made in a few
            lines of JavaScript. <code>Click</code> to draw cells, <code>Cmd/Ctrl + click</code> to draw rectangles, and
            press the <code>spacebar</code> to
            run.
        <li>
            <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan/"><b>MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan</a></b>: I
            traveled with my wife in a self-made van around North America (from Alaska to Mexico) for 8 months while
            I was working as a
            freelance software developer. This is a static blog about our
            adventures,
            with a simple <code>Python</code>
            script converting from <code>Markdown</code> to <code>HTML</code> via a <code>Jinja</code> template,
            and
            hosted directly on <code>GitHub</code>, and using <code>Google Photos</code> to host the high quality
            pictures.

    </ul>
