    <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage üëã</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="mailto:antoine dot fauroux at gmail dot com">Antoine Fauroux</a> and I'm a doctor in
        plasma physics interested in many things including computer science and programming in general.</p>

    <p>My main programming language is <code>Python</code> <em>(Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib)</em>, as I
        wrote
        many scripts, notebooks, and modules for physics simulations, data management, and data analysis during my
        studies, research internships, and my PhD. I would
        not release those script because they were only useful for my work but you can consult my publications <a
            href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=fr&user=Bwj03iIAAAAJ">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I accumulated many small projects over the years on my github page and this page is an attempt at
        advertising my programing skills by making those projects easily accessible for whomever might be interested.
        Here is a list of the ones that are more or less finished and accessible online: </p>

    <h2>Small <code>html/css/js</code> projects</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/chess/"><b>Chess RTC</b></a>: quick and easy chess game, made out of
            javascript/html/css using the lib <code>chess.js</code> from <code>@jhlywa</code>, and allowing connection
            between 2 players in p2p via
            webRTC
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/BeautifulSnake/"><b>Snake</b></a>: This is the result of
            tests I did with html5 canvas: A simple webpage that allows play snake made with material design
            styling
        <li> <a href="https://catpaint-89d4e.firebaseapp.com/"><b>Cat Paint</b></a>: Another test of html5 canvas and
            hosted on firebase, that I did in collaboration with my sister, where you can paint with cat emojis üêà
        <li> <a href="https://afauroux.github.io/conway-game-of-life/"><b>Conway's game of life</b></a>: made in a few
            lines of javascript. <code>Click</code> to draw cells, <code>Cmd/Ctrl + click</code> to draw rectangles, and
            press the <code>spacebar</code> to
            run.
        <li><b><a href="https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/user.php?id=1040">LowRes NX</b></a>: is a retro-game virtual
            console. I developed several mini-games for this platform with a friend of mine to understand better
            retro-consoles and to have fun. I was also involved in the porting of this open-source console to
            <a href="https://www.libretro.com/index.php/lowres-nx-a-new-fantasy-console-core/">RetroArch
            </a> so games could be played on any consoles/systems.
    </ul>

    <h2>Other projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/ur/larn/logiciels/nascam">Nascam</a></b>: A modular
            graphical user interface and visualisation tool that I wrote in Java, for a kinetic-Monte-Carlo simulation
            software developed at
            the university of Namur. I also coordinated the work of several other developers and help release this
            software to the scientific community.

        <li>
            <p><b><a href="https://afauroux.github.io/MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan/">MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan</a></b>: I
                traveled with my wife in a self-made van around North America (from Alaska to Mexico) for 8 months while
                I was working as a
                freelance software developer.
            </p>I made a static blog about our
            adventures,
            with a simple <code>Python</code>
            script converting from <code>Markdown</code> to <code>HTML</code> via a <code>Jinja</code> templates, and
            hosted directly on <code>Github</code>, and using <code>Google Photos</code> to host the high quality
            pictures.
    </ul>
